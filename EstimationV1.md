# Project Estimation - CURRENT

Date: 05/05/2024

Version: v1

# Estimation approach

Consider the EZElectronics project in CURRENT version (as given by the teachers), assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course, and from scratch

# Estimate by size

NOTE: Calculations performed assuming each person works 8 hours per day, 5 days a week.

| NC = Estimated number of classes to be developed                                                        | 21                      |
